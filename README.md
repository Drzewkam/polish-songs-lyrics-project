The project involves developing a clustering model that, based on previously collected data (song lyrics from the website wywrota.pl), visualizes the relationships between Polish music artists. The initial scope of the project assumes that all lyrics are in Polish and focuses on Polish performers. However, there is potential for future expansion to include translated lyrics from other languages. The dataset consists of approximately 10,000 song lyrics. Clustering was first performed using the K-Means algorithm, followed by visualization with T-SNE.
